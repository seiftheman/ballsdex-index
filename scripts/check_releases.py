"""
Check that cogs in data/cogs.json have a tagged release matching their
pyproject.toml version. Used by the PR validation workflow to warn
contributors when a cog's declared version has no corresponding release.

Usage: check_releases.py <output_md_path> [ids_file]

If ids_file is given, only cogs whose id appears in it (one id per line) are
checked — used to scope the check to the cog(s) a PR actually touches instead
of every cog already in cogs.json. Without it, all cogs are checked.

Prints one line per cog missing a release and exits non-zero if any are found,
so the workflow can decide whether to post a PR comment.
